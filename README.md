# Data Visualization Portfolio Project: Analyze data on GDP and life expectancy 

## The relationship between life expectancy and GDP

This project explores the relationship between life expectancy and GDP using data visualization techniques.

Project Objectives:
* Preprocess, explore, and analyze data
* Using seaborn and Matplotlib to create visualizations
* Becoming familiar with presenting and sharing data visualizations

Here are a few questions that this project will seek to answer:

+ Has life expectancy increased over time in the six nations?
+ Has GDP increased over time in the six nations?
+ Is there a correlation between GDP and life expectancy of a country?
+ What is the average life expectancy in these nations?
+ What is the distribution of that life expectancy?

The data is sourced from the World Health Organization and the World Bank.

- GDP Source: [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD) national accounts data, and OECD National Accounts data files.
- Life expectancy Data Source: [World Health Organization](http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.688)

This project analyzes, prepares, and presents the data in a chart to answer questions in a meaningful way.
